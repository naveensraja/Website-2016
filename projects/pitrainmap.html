        <h6>My Role: Design Research Lead</h6>
        
        <h6>Time Frame: November 2015</h6>
<!--___________________________ Intro________________________________________ -->        
        <h3>Intro</h3>
        
        <p>As part of the on-boarding process to IBM Design, the studio runs an incubator program. The incubator program takes some of the hardest problems in IBM and puts design as a focus to create a solution. The catch is, these are six week sprints. Together visual designers, ui/ux designers, design researchers and front end developers create blue sky solutions. The final pitch showcased a deliverable to business unit executives in product, engineering and sales.</p>

        <p>The project brief focused around <a href="https://presenceinsights.ng.bluemix.net/piui/">Presence Insights (PI)</a>.</p>

<!--___________________________ Strategy________________________________________ -->          
        <h3>Strategy</h3>
        <p>During our PI sprint we dove deep into user research. Over the course of six-weeks we conducted a series of generative interviews. I believe that research is a key tool that brings teams together and creates alignment. This instance was no different. I worked along side my friend and colleague <a href="http://www.upandadam.co/">Adam Lehman</a>. Together we wanted to make a visualization of our key insights of 8-10 hours of user interviews. How could we make it easy to consume and still be impactful?</p>

        <p><strong>We wanted to create an artifact that highlighted the journey of each user to understand intersection points.</strong></p>

<!--___________________________ Process________________________________________ -->              
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>The image below is the initial synthesis that my team and I did around our users.</p>

        <img src="../img/trainmap/train_1.png" alt="initial insights">

        <p>From this image, I went through each user and began creating a journey. What would their process look like? What are they thinking? What are they saying? What are they doing?</p>

        <p>By going through this exercise I was able to boil down complex information. I pushed to create stories for my team to use in the design process.
        <br><br>
        The biggest fear that I had was that this information was only going to make sense to myself. I wanted to make sure that any stakeholder could pick up my research. In a glance I wanted someone to understand who we were designing for and what were their pain points. I teamed up with Adam, the visual designer from my team to understand what might be the best way to map this out.
        <br><br>
        Both Adam and I are from big cities. He is from Detroit and I am from Chicago. Nostalgia would come upon us when we would think about our upbringings. We could never agree on which city had better food but we both have a love for public transportation. Public transport is interesting because at it’s core it is a complicated system. Hundreds of trains zipping across miles of metropolitan landscape, how do thousands of people make sense of it all?
        <br><br>
        Train maps. Train maps are a brilliant piece of design because they do a few different things really well. One, they are color coded. The association to color allows a user of said map to follow one specific line across a large area of land.</p>

        <img src="../img/trainmap/train_2.png" alt="Chicago + NYC Train Map">

        <p>When looking at the maps above from Chicago and NYC, it does not matter whether you go forward or backward the start and finish section are always the same. 
        <br><br>
        Two, they acknowledge and highlight the intersection points. A key component of a train map is transfers. You see where commonalities exist between different lines and where you could follow a different route. </p>

        <img src="../img/trainmap/train_3.png" alt="Tokyo Map">
        
        <p>Even in the case of a map from Tokyo, a foreigner can still make sense of the information. Brilliant.
        <br><br>
        If we applied these principles to our research artifact we would be able to create something powerful. Adam and I got to work. We spent about 4 hours stitching and weaving together the journeys of our users. It was an attempt to tell their stories and understand where did they all intersect.
        <br><br>
        Below is our final artifact deliverable.</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        
        <p>The original intention for this artifact was to take a large data set and make it digestible. By synthesizing the information into a series of journeys it allowed the collective PI team to build empathy for the users.
        <br><br>
        Used in the initial production of PI as a baseline for insights the map got updated as the project pushed forward. </p>
