        <p id="story">Storytelling is one of the world’s oldest art forms. Much like how no two days are the exact same, my story is different than most. My story has laughter, inspiring conversations and one motorcycle accident in Indonesia. I have embraced challenge and converted it into beautiful moments of clarity and break-through. This website is how I, as a passionate designer, want to share my story. Blending the lines of what design is and what it could be is where I find my inspiration. Work represents how I spend my time. My day-to-day adventures as a designer are a weird intersection of enterprise software, facilitation, entrepreneurship and traveling. Truth be told, I love it.</p>
