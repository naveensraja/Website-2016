        <p id="story"> Story telling is one of the world’s oldest art forms. Much like how no two days are the exact same, my story is different than most. It's roots are in laughter, great conversation with folk from all over the world and one motorcycle accident in Indonesia. I have embraced challenge and converted it into beautiful moments of clarity and break-through. This website is how I as a passionate designer want to share my story. Work represents where I spend my time. It is a weird intersection of enterprise software, facilitation, entrepreneurship and traveling. I love it. Blending the lines of what design is and what it could be, is where I find inspiration.</p>

          <p class="copy">IBM's incubator program is unique take around on-boarding new designers. It matches ambitious designers with some of IBM's hardest problems.

            <p class="copy">IDT is IBM's own flavor of design thinking. Fueled by research from my users I created a hands-on design thinking workshop for "non-designers". I wrote this three-part case study to highlight the scoping, delivery and reflection of this workshop. Shared with over 2000+ people, it reinforces how powerful of a tool design thinking can be for anyone. <a href="https://medium.com/@naveenraja/scoping-a-workshop-for-non-designers-47bcc01757ce#.59ytn46fd" target="blank">Click here to read more...</a></p>
