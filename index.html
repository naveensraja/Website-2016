        <p id="story"> Story telling is one of the world’s oldest art forms. Much like how no two days are the exact same, my story is different than most. It's roots are in laughter, great conversation with folks from all over the world and one motorcycle accident in Indonesia. I have embraced challenge and converted it into beautiful moments of clarity and break-through. This website is how I as a passionate designer want to share my story. Work represents where I spend my time. It is a weird intersection of enterprise software, facilitation, entrepreneurship and traveling. I love it. Blending the lines of what design is and what it could be, is where I find inspiration.</p>

            <p class="copy">IDT is IBM's own flavor of design thinking. Fueled by research from my users I created a hands-on design thinking workshop for "non-designers". I wrote this three-part case study to highlight the scoping, delivery and reflection of this workshop. Shared with over 2000+ people, it reinforces how powerful of a tool design thinking can be for anyone. <a href="https://medium.com/@naveenraja/scoping-a-workshop-for-non-designers-47bcc01757ce#.59ytn46fd" target="blank">Click here to read more...</a></p>

Their co-founder reached out to me to consult with the team as a design strategist. Over the course of two months, I was able to build an understanding of the user, establish a growth strategy, build a full kickstarter campaign and bring in ~900 sales equaling $50,000. <a href="projects/travelmore.html" target="blank">Click here to read more...</a></p>

                As a designer, I focus on taking complex information and making it simple. During the IBM incubator project, I worked to build a deep understanding of my users. I wanted to share this understanding with my team and my stakeholders. I worked with a visual designer to synthesize hours of design research into one easy to understand graphic.
